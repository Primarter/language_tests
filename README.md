## Launch

* Clone the repository
* Launch the different sorts by typing ```./sort.[extension] `./test_generator.sh` ``` or typing ```make``` in the folder of the sort and then launching the sort as with the others.

## Development

* If you ever want to add a language to that repo, your sort program must take the list as parameter, the test_generator can be modified to give a different number of values. Moreover, you should be able to launch it quickly and easily so that it can be added to this README.
